## WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# Experimental

This repository contains throw-away prototypes for experimental tools and libraries related to decompilation. They are intended to evaluate concepts, validate ideas, and stress-test designs. Once this insight has been gained, they will be removed in favour of high-quality re-implementations.
