# Experimental

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/decomp/exp?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/decomp/exp)

This repository contains throw-away prototypes for experimental tools and libraries related to decompilation. They are intended to facilitate understanding, evaluate concepts, validate ideas, and stress-test designs. Once this insight has been gained, they will be removed in favour of high-quality re-implementations.
